Week 4 Challenge JavaScript and API Quiz

## Dynamically Updated Quiz Challenge

The challenge for this week involved creating a timed and dynamically updated quiz using Javascript. 

### Quiz Functionality

When the user clicks on the start quiz button, a countdown timer begins and the user is presented with a series of multiple choice quiz questions concerning Javascript knowledge, pulled from an array of questions. If the user selects the correct answer a bell is rung, a point is added to their score, and the next question is loaded.

If an incorrect answer is selected, a negative buzzer sound effect fires, and a penalty of 15 seconds is subtracted from the remaining time. 

Once all questions are answered or the quiz timer runs out, the users score is displayed and they are presented with an input box where they may enter their initials and save their score to a High Scores page. Upon hitting the submit button they are taken to the High Scores page to view a list of high scores for the quiz. The High Scores page data is saved locally so it will not be erased on a page refresh, and the page also has an option button to clear the high score list.

### Challenges

This was a significant increase in difficulty versus the previous challenges, even with the starter code framework provided by the instructor. However, it was extraordinarly rewarding to finally witness the quiz functioning properly through all phases.

Due to the effort in creating this code, as well as external time restraints, this code contains almost no CSS formatting and is presented in a plain HTML text format. It is my plan to remedy this and add appropriate styling to make the quiz more appealing and user friendly and resubmitting when time allows.
